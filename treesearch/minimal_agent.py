        - If a requirement is general best practice but not necessary for this task, exclude it

        2. Abstraction: State objectives and constraints at an appropriate level
        - Avoid excessive implementation details (exact formulas, nested conditional logic, code-level instructions)
        - Include critical technical specifications where they matter (framework to use, specific datasets, evaluation metrics, split ratios)

        3. Atomicity: Each requirement should test one distinct aspect of the experiment

        4. Coverage: Include requirements for all essential aspects:
        - Data loading and preprocessing
        - Experimental methodology (data splitting, reproducibility requirements)
        - Model/algorithm selection and configuration — ALWAYS include a requirement that OmniRec must be used for all recommender system functionality; raw backend libraries (Lenskit, RecBole, etc.) must not be called directly
        - Training procedures
        - Evaluation methodology and metrics
        - Critical outputs and results

        Include both technical requirements (correct tool/API usage) and conceptual requirements (methodologically sound experiment design), but keep it as minimal as possible.

        - Technical correctness (proper use of tools/APIs, data handling, reproducibility)
        - Conceptual correctness (valid experimental design for the research question)
